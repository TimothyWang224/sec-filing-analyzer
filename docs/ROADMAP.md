# SEC Filing Analyzer Roadmap

This document outlines the planned enhancements and future development directions for the SEC Filing Analyzer project.

## Current Status

The SEC Filing Analyzer currently provides:

- Complete ETL pipeline for SEC filings
- Semantic processing with chunking and embeddings
- Quantitative processing with XBRL extraction
- Vector storage and search capabilities
- Graph database integration with Neo4j
- Structured data storage in DuckDB

## Short-Term Enhancements (1-3 months)

### 1. FAISS Optimization

- [x] Implement HNSW indexing for improved search performance
- [x] Add configurable parameters for FAISS indexes
- [x] Create master ETL script with centralized configuration
- [ ] Benchmark different index types (flat, IVF, HNSW) for performance comparison
- [ ] Develop auto-tuning for FAISS parameters based on dataset size

### 2. ETL Pipeline Improvements

- [ ] Implement incremental updates to avoid reprocessing existing filings
- [ ] Add support for delta updates to FAISS indexes
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement data validation checks throughout the pipeline

### 3. DuckDB Integration

- [ ] Optimize schema design for financial metrics
- [ ] Add more financial ratios and calculations
- [ ] Create views for common financial analysis queries
- [ ] Implement time-series analysis capabilities
- [ ] Add data export functionality to CSV/Excel

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 months)

### 1. GPU Acceleration

- [ ] Add GPU support for FAISS indexing
  - [ ] Implement GPU resource management
  - [ ] Add CPU fallback mechanisms for large datasets
  - [ ] Optimize for different GPU memory constraints
  - [ ] Support for RTX 3060 with 6GB VRAM
  - [ ] Add performance metrics and comparison tools

### 2. Advanced Search Capabilities

- [ ] Implement hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- [ ] Add semantic filtering options
- [ ] Create domain-specific search interfaces
- [ ] Develop relevance feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Add support for multi-query search
- [ ] Implement comprehensive entity recognition with NER models
- [ ] Create cross-document section linking for comparative analysis
- [ ] Extract and structure financial data from tables

### 3. Visualization and Reporting

- [ ] Create interactive dashboards for financial data
- [ ] Implement comparative analysis tools
- [ ] Add chart generation for key metrics
- [ ] Develop PDF report generation
- [ ] Create anomaly detection visualizations

## Long-Term Vision (6+ months)

### 1. Advanced Analytics

- [ ] Implement financial sentiment analysis
- [ ] Add trend detection algorithms
- [ ] Create predictive models for financial metrics
- [ ] Develop cross-company comparison tools
- [ ] Implement industry benchmarking
- [ ] Add sentiment and tone analysis to chunks
- [ ] Implement specialized financial metrics extraction
- [ ] Create semantic similarity scores between chunks as weighted relationships

### 2. LLM Integration

- [ ] Create specialized agents for financial analysis
- [ ] Implement RAG systems with financial domain knowledge
- [ ] Develop natural language query interfaces
- [ ] Add summarization capabilities for filings
- [ ] Create automated insights generation

### 3. Scalability Enhancements

- [ ] Implement distributed processing for very large datasets
- [ ] Add multi-GPU support for FAISS
- [ ] Develop cloud deployment options
- [ ] Create containerized deployment with Docker
- [ ] Implement API services for external applications

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- [ ] Documentation improvements and tutorials
- [ ] Code refactoring for maintainability
- [ ] Performance optimization for core components
- [ ] Security enhancements for data access

## Feedback and Prioritization

This roadmap is a living document that will evolve based on user feedback and changing requirements. Priority will be given to features that provide the most value to users and align with the project's core mission of making SEC filing data more accessible and actionable.
