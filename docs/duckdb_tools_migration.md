# DuckDB Tools Migration

This document explains the migration from custom DuckDB visualization and CLI tools to the built-in DuckDB UI.

## Overview

The SEC Filing Analyzer previously included several custom tools for exploring and visualizing DuckDB databases:

- DuckDB CLI scripts
- DuckDB Explorer scripts
- Streamlit-based DuckDB visualization pages

These tools have been replaced with the built-in DuckDB UI, which provides a more powerful and user-friendly interface for exploring DuckDB databases.

## Removed Components

The following components have been removed:

### Streamlit Pages

- `src/streamlit_app/pages/duckdb_connect.py`
- `src/streamlit_app/pages/duckdb_explorer_alt.py`
- `src/streamlit_app/pages/duckdb_explorer_debug.py`
- `src/streamlit_app/pages/duckdb_minimal.py`
- `src/streamlit_app/pages/duckdb_tables.py`

### Python Scripts

- `scripts/db/duckdb/duckdb_cli.py`
- `scripts/db/duckdb/explore_duckdb.py`
- `scripts/db/duckdb/query_duckdb.py`
- `scripts/visualization/launch_duckdb_explorer.py`
- `scripts/visualization/launch_duckdb_web.py`
- `scripts/visualization/simple_duckdb_explorer.py`
- `scripts/visualization/streamlit_duckdb_explorer.py`

### Batch Files

- All files in `scripts/batch/duckdb_explorer/`

## New DuckDB UI Integration

The DuckDB UI is now integrated into the SEC Filing Analyzer in the following locations:

1. **Home Page**: "Open DuckDB UI" button in the Quick Actions section
2. **Data Explorer**: "Launch DuckDB UI" button in the DuckDB Tools section
3. **ETL Data Inventory**: "Open DuckDB UI" button in the Data Summary section

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed redundant code and dependencies
2. **Improved User Experience**: The DuckDB UI provides a more intuitive and feature-rich interface
3. **Better Maintenance**: Using the built-in DuckDB UI reduces the maintenance burden
4. **Consistent Interface**: All users now have the same experience when exploring DuckDB databases

## Documentation

For more information about using the DuckDB UI, please refer to:

- [DuckDB UI Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/ui.html)
- [SEC Filing Analyzer DuckDB UI Guide](docs/duckdb_ui.md)

## Technical Details

The DuckDB UI is implemented as a DuckDB extension called `ui`. It is automatically installed when needed and runs as a local web server on your machine. Your data never leaves your computer.

The integration with the SEC Filing Analyzer is implemented through a utility function `launch_duckdb_ui()` in `src/streamlit_app/utils.py`.
