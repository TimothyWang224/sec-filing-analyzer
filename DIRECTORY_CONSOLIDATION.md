# Directory Structure Consolidation

This document describes the directory structure consolidation that was performed to clean up the project before the final commit.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed `sec_filing_analyzer` directory**
   - This directory was a compatibility layer that imported from `src/tools`
   - All functionality is now in `src/sec_filing_analyzer`

2. **Moved `src/scripts` to `scripts/src_scripts_backup`**
   - All scripts from `src/scripts` have been moved to `scripts/src_scripts_backup`
   - A README.md file has been added to explain the purpose of this directory

3. **Moved `src/archive` to `archive/semantic`**
   - All archived code from `src/archive` has been moved to `archive/semantic`

4. **Updated documentation**
   - Updated `docs/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` to reflect the new directory structure

## Purpose

The purpose of this consolidation was to:

1. Eliminate duplicate directories and code
2. Create a cleaner, more organized directory structure
3. Make the project easier to navigate and understand
4. Prepare the project for the final commit

## Future Improvements

If you decide to continue working on this project in the future, consider:

1. Moving the most useful scripts from `scripts/src_scripts_backup` to the appropriate subdirectories in `scripts`
2. Refactoring any useful code from `archive` into the main codebase
3. Further organizing the `src` directory to better separate concerns
